occupycanhas:
---------------

A site to help people coordinate services during the OWS movements.

Folks should be able to tweet that they need ([@occupycanhas](http://twitter.com/occupycanhas)) or have ([@occupyhas](http://twitter.com/occupyhas)) things for use.

Use cases detailed below:

`@willowbl00` sez: `@OccupyCanHas we need a #tent down here in #seattle #westlake` (adds to map)

`@benacker` sez: `I dropped a #tent to @willowbl00 via @OccupyHas.` (removes from map)

Here's some requests:

* geotag themselves when safe and possible
* don't split tweets - follow up with more info if necessary, but include all meta in one
* include @OccupyHas for things they need
* include @OccupyCanHas for things they can provide
 * include twitter handle of person who requested when responding to a request
* use appropriate hash tags
 * city or city abbreviation (it'll be up to us to include "#occupy AND #seattle" or "#occupyseattle" or "@occupyseattle" or "#ows #sea") or just request people be clear.
 * needs tags can be #shelter #warmth #food #water #medical #legal #media #backup - further detail should be in the tweet itself, but those will have graphics
